This is an endorsed Smart Nation initiative (first in a citizen-fronting deployable application space) and will involve the creation of a nation-wide platform to collect, through smart devices such as wearables, real-time and personalized biometric and wellness data.  Such data, matched to clinical records, can create personalized applications, delivered through smart devices, that will help nudge our citizens to healthier behaviours; predict or even pre-empt medical situations like stroke, falls and heart attacks; and improve chronic disease management and coordination of care across health, social and consumer entities. The platform is an open public-private one with government playing the role of a neutral and trusted data-broker to multi-lateralise data-sharing for health innovation and service delivery.
 
This project has the ambition to create a step-improvement in health promotion and chronic disease management, pioneering capabilities with tech giants to front global-first co-innovation. It will also allow for the real time tracking of the Singapore population's health behaviours, and potentially give Government a much more accurate read of how the population responds to policy changes and allow for personalised services delivered at national scale.  By providing a research platform for new medical interventions, it has the potential to accelerate the adoption of a whole range of clinical interventions.  The project will involve a range private sector players coming in to use Singapore as a test bed to trial new products and services in precision health and medicine.  Key technologies that are likely to be trialled in this project are health related wearable and sensor technology, big data analytics, machine learning, behavioural science, genomics and precision medicine.
